found letter.

The walls are watching.
Do not trust the light.
The key hides where shadows gather.
Time will judge you.
Some doors must stay closed.
Whispers move in corners.
Footsteps appear where none should be.
A clock ticks backward here.
Follow the silence.
Remember: not all who wander are lost, but some never return.
